http://gitforeverybody.com/ is designed to help people learn Git (and more advanced Git) from scratch. It is a 3 hour premium course.

In this Git Essentials / Git for Everybody course, you'll learn everything I use in a daily work flow, including:
* creating a new repo
* adding ssh keys
* branching
* merging 
* rebasing
* tagging
* resolving merge/rebase conflicts 
* (it covers A LOT more than the Git & GitHub Crash Course teaches)
